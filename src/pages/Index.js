      <h3>Welcome to Yoga!</h3>
      <p>
        Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice that originated in
        ancient India. First codified by the sage Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras
        around 400 C.E, the practice was in fact handed down from teacher to
        student long before this text arose. Traditionally, this was a
        one-to-one transmission, but since yoga became popular in the West in
        the 20th century, group classes have become the norm.
        <br /> The word yoga is derived from the Sanskrit root yuj, meaning “to
        yoke,” or “to unite”. The practice aims to create union between body,
        mind and spirit, as well as between the individual self and universal
        consciousness. Such a union tends to neutralize ego-driven thoughts and
        behaviours, creating a sense of spiritual awakening. <br /> Yoga has
        been practiced for thousands of years, and whilst many different
        interpretations and styles have been developed, most tend to agree that
        the ultimate goal of yoga is to achieve liberation from suffering.
        Although each school or tradition of yoga has its own emphasis and
        practices, most focus on bringing together body, mind and breath as a
        means of altering energy or shifting consciousness.

        Yoga is essentially a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle
        science, which focuses on bringing harmony between mind and body. It is
        an art and science of healthy living. <br /> The word ‘Yoga’ is derived
        from the Sanskrit root ‘Yuj’, meaning ‘to join’ or ‘to yoke’ or ‘to
        unite’. As per Yogic scriptures the practice of Yoga leads to the union
        of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness,
        indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body, Man & Nature.{" "}
        <br />
        According to modern scientists, everything in the universe is just a
        manifestation of the same quantum firmament. One who experiences this
        oneness of existence is said to be in yoga, and is termed as a yogi,
        having attained to a state of freedom referred to as mukti, nirvana or
        moksha. Thus the aim of Yoga is Self-realization, to overcome all kinds
        of sufferings leading to 'the state of liberation' (Moksha) or 'freedom'
        (Kaivalya). Living with freedom in all walks of life, health and harmony
        shall be the main objectives of Yoga practice.

          500 BC - 800 A.D. <br />
          Tentatively, the period between 500 BC - 800 A.D. is considered as the
          Classical period which is also considered as the most fertile and
          prominent period in the history and development of Yoga. <br /> During
          this period, commentaries of Vyasa on Yoga Sutras and Bhagawadgita
          etc. came into existence.This period can be mainly dedicated to two
          great religious teachers of India –Mahavir and Buddha. The concept of
          Five great vows – Pancha mahavrata- by Mahavir and Ashta Magga or
          eightfold path by Buddha - can be well considered as early nature of
          Yoga sadhana. We find its more explicit explanation in Bhagawadgita
          which has elaborately presented the concept of Gyan yoga, Bhakti yoga
          and Karma Yoga. <br /> These three types of yoga are still the highest
          example of human wisdom and and even to day people find peace by
          following the methods as shown in Gita. Patanjali’s yoga sutra besides
          containing various aspects of yoga, is mainly identified with eight
          fold path of Yoga.

          800 A.D. - 1700 A.D. <br />
          The very important commentary on Yoga sutra by Vyasa was also written.
          During this very period the aspect of mind was given importance and it
          was clearly brought out through Yoga sadhana, Mind and body both can
          be brought under control to experience equanimity. <br /> The period
          between 800 A.D. - 1700 A.D. has been recognized as the Post Classical
          period wherein the teachings of great Acharyatrayas-Adi Shankracharya,
          Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya-were prominent during this period.
          <br /> The teachings of Suradasa, Tulasidasa, Purandardasa, Mirabai
          were the great contributors during this period. The Natha Yogis of
          Hathayoga Tradition like Matsyendaranatha, Gorkshanatha,
          Cauranginatha, Swatmaram Suri, Gheranda, Shrinivasa Bhatt are some of
          the great personalities who popularized the Hatha Yoga practices
          during this period.

          1700 - 1900 A.D. <br />
          The period between 1700 - 1900 A.D. is considered as Modern period in
          which the great Yogacharyas- Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna Paramhansa,
          Paramhansa Yogananda, Vivekananda etc. have contributed for the
          development of Raja Yoga. <br /> This was the period when Vedanta,
          Bhakti yoga, Nathayoga or Hatha-yoga flourished. The Shadanga-yoga of
          Gorakshashatakam, Chaturanga-yoga of Hathayogapradipika, Saptanga-yoga
          of Gheranda Samhita, were the main tenents of Hatha-yoga. <br /> Now
          in the contemporary times, everybody has conviction about yoga
          practices towards the preservation, maintenance and promotion of
          health. Yoga has spread all over the world by the teachings of great
          personalities like Swami Shivananda, Shri T.Krishnamacharya, Swami
          Kuvalayananda, Shri Yogendara, Swami Rama, Sri Aurobindo, Maharshi
          Mahesh Yogi, Acharya Rajanish, Pattabhijois, BKS. Iyengar, Swami
          Satyananda Sarasvati and the like.

      <h3>So Yoga is...</h3>
      <p>
        So Yoga is... (Conclusion)
        <br />
        Yoga works on the level of one’s body, mind, emotion and energy. <br />{" "}
        This has given rise to four broad classifications of Yoga: karma yoga,
        where we utilize the body; bhakti yoga, where we utilize the emotions;
        gyana yoga, where we utilize the mind and intelect; and kriya yoga,
        where we utilize the energy. Each system of Yoga we practice would fall
        within the gamut of one or more of these categories. <br /> Every
        individual is a unique combination of these four factors. "All the
        ancient commentaries on Yoga have stressed that it is essential to work
        under the direction of a Guru.” The reason being that only a Guru can
        mix the appropriate combination of the four fundamental paths, as is
        necessary for each seeker. <br /> Yoga Education:Tradiitionally, Yoga
        Education was imparted by knowledgeable, experienced, and wise persons
        in the families (comparable with the education imparted in convents in
        the west) and then by the Seers (Rishis/Munis/Acharyas) in Ashramas
        (compared with monastries). Yoga Education, on the other hand, aims at
        taking care of the individual, the 'Being'. It is presumed that a good,
        balanced, integrated, truthful, clean, transparent person will be more
        useful to oneself, family, society, nation, nature and humanity at
        large.
