      <h3>Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
      <p>
        Vinyasa yoga is also called “flow yoga” or “vinyasa flow”. It is an
        incredibly common style. One example is 3 Week Yoga Retreat’s flow yoga
        for beginners. It was adapted from the more regimented ashtanga practice
        a couple of decades ago. The word “vinyasa” translates to “place in a
        special way,” which is often interpreted as linking breath and movement.
        You’ll often see words like slow, dynamic, or mindful paired with
        vinyasa or flow to indicate the intensity of a practice. “Vinyasa flow
        is a style of yoga where the poses are synchronized with the breath in a
        continuous rhythmic flow,” says Sherrell Moore-Tucker, RYT 200. “The
        flow can be meditative in nature, calming the mind and nervous system,
        even though you’re moving.” <br /> Vinyasa yoga is suitable for those
        who’ve never tried yoga as well as those who’ve been practicing for
        years. <br /> <strong>Who Might Like It:</strong> Anyone who wants more
        movement and less stillness from their yoga practice.

      <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
      <p>
        Hatha yoga derives its name from the Sanskrit words for sun and moon,
        and it’s designed to balance opposing forces. The balance in hatha yoga
        might come from strength and flexibility, physical and mental energy, or
        breath and the body. “Hatha is a blanket term for many different
        ‘styles’ and schools that use the body as a means for self-inquiry,”
        says Jennifer Campbell-Overbeeke, E-RYT 500.
        <br /> It’s often used as a catch-all term for the physical side of
        yoga, is more traditional in nature, or is billed as yoga for beginners.
        “Hatha translates to ‘forceful,’ but this relates more to the aspect of
        concentration and regularity of practice rather than applying
        unnecessary force to the body,” says Campbell-Overbeeke.
        <br /> To be considered hatha, classes must include a mix of asana
        (poses), pranayama (breathing exercises), and meditation, so other types
        of yoga — like Iyengar, ashtanga, or Bikram — are technically considered
        to be hatha yoga as well.
        <br /> <strong>Who Might Like It:</strong> Anyone looking for a balanced
        practice, or those in search of a gentler type of yoga.
      </p>
      <h3>Aerial Yoga</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Aerial yoga —</strong> sometimes called anti-gravity yoga — is
        relatively new, but quickly catching on. It involves traditional yoga
        poses with the added support of a strong, silky hammock that hangs from
        the ceiling. The hammock is used as a supportive prop in poses like
        pigeon or downward dog, and helps you more easily perform inverted poses
        (like headstands and handstands) that might be beyond your abilities or
        comfort levels. It’s also used for a cocoon-like savasana (the final
        resting pose at the end of a yoga class). Classes can be either
        physically challenging or relaxing. <br /> “Teaching aerial yoga has
        been so rewarding for me because I get to witness beginners gain body
        awareness and overcome fear of being inverted,” says Melissa Vance, RYT
        (Registered Yoga Teacher) 200, an aerial yoga teacher based outside of
        Atlanta. “Hanging upside down reverses the blood flow in the body and
        decompresses the spine providing much relief and a euphoric feeling.”{" "}
        <br />
        <strong>Who Might Like It:</strong>
        Those who want a nontraditional yoga experience, or anyone who wants the
        benefits of inversions but might fear going upside down on their own.
      </p>
      <h3>Acro yoga</h3>
      <p>
        Acro yoga takes familiar yoga poses — like downward dog or plank — and
        makes them double the fun (and sometimes double the work) by adding a
        partner. One partner serves as the “base” on the ground, while the other
        is the “flyer” who contorts themselves on the soles of the base’s feet.
        (A spotter should always be involved for safety). “[Acro yoga] allows
        people to break from the rectangular confines of their yoga mat and find
        a connection with their fellow practitioners,” says Lyle Mitchell, a
        YogaSlackers acro yoga teacher in Asheville, NC. <br /> This type of
        yoga helps you playfully explore your mind-body connection, develops
        effective communication skills with a partner, and aids in setting
        appropriate boundaries. “Exploring these skills through acro yoga can
        translate to strengthening these skills in all our other relationships
        in life,” he says. Saunders recommends acro yoga “if you are looking for
        the physical benefits of yoga in a fun and interactive environment.” If
        you work as a base, it builds a strong lower body and core. Working as a
        flyer requires flexibility and strength, not to mention trust. <br />
        <strong>Who Might Like It:</strong> Those who enjoy practicing with a
        partner, couples looking to build trust and intimacy, or anyone with an
        adventurous streak who likes to go upside down.

      <p>
        This is Beginner's Flow of Lukas & Margaretka. <br /> A man lifts a
        woman by his arms and legs while lying down facing the ceiling. At this
        time, the woman is looking at the ceiling and has her face on the side
        of the man's legs. The man's feet rest on the woman's shoulder blades,
        and the man's hands rest on the woman's ankles. After the woman lifts
        one leg, she bends her knee and rests her foot on the man's hand. The
        man supports the woman's feet with both hands, and the man's feet
        support the woman's hips, causing the woman to slowly sit down. After
        holding her position for a few seconds, she hooks both of the woman's
        feet into the back of the man's knees, freeing the man's hands. After
        that, the woman and the man hold hands, unfasten the woman's leg from
        the back of the man's lap, and stretch it behind her. The man's feet
        support the woman's pelvis. Then, slowly, the woman and the man release
        their hands, and the woman floats in the air with only the man's feet.
        After the woman bends her knees and does a simple stretch, the woman and
        man hold hands again. Again, the woman places her legs behind the man's
        knees and releases her hands to straighten her back upwards. After
        briefly holding her palms together, the woman assumes a sitting position
        and supports the woman's feet with the man's hands. The woman slowly
        lies down and the man's feet rest on her woman's shoulder blades. The
        woman spreads her legs and the man bends her arms as she comes down to
        the ground.
