      <h3>Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
      <p>
        Vinyasa yoga is also called “flow yoga” or “vinyasa flow”. It is an
        incredibly common style. One example is 3 Week Yoga Retreat’s flow yoga
        for beginners. It was adapted from the more regimented ashtanga practice
        a couple of decades ago. The word “vinyasa” translates to “place in a
        special way,” which is often interpreted as linking breath and movement.
        You’ll often see words like slow, dynamic, or mindful paired with
        vinyasa or flow to indicate the intensity of a practice. “Vinyasa flow
        is a style of yoga where the poses are synchronized with the breath in a
        continuous rhythmic flow,” says Sherrell Moore-Tucker, RYT 200. “The
        flow can be meditative in nature, calming the mind and nervous system,
        even though you’re moving.” <br /> Vinyasa yoga is suitable for those
        who’ve never tried yoga as well as those who’ve been practicing for
        years. <br /> Who Might Like It: Anyone who wants more movement and less
        stillness from their yoga practice.

      <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
      <p>
        Hatha yoga derives its name from the Sanskrit words for sun and moon,
        and it’s designed to balance opposing forces. The balance in hatha yoga
        might come from strength and flexibility, physical and mental energy, or
        breath and the body. “Hatha is a blanket term for many different
        ‘styles’ and schools that use the body as a means for self-inquiry,”
        says Jennifer Campbell-Overbeeke, E-RYT 500.
        <br /> It’s often used as a catch-all term for the physical side of
        yoga, is more traditional in nature, or is billed as yoga for beginners.
        “Hatha translates to ‘forceful,’ but this relates more to the aspect of
        concentration and regularity of practice rather than applying
        unnecessary force to the body,” says Campbell-Overbeeke.
        <br /> To be considered hatha, classes must include a mix of asana
        (poses), pranayama (breathing exercises), and meditation, so other types
        of yoga — like Iyengar, ashtanga, or Bikram — are technically considered
        to be hatha yoga as well. Who Might Like It: Anyone looking for a
        balanced practice, or those in search of a gentler type of yoga.

      <h3>Aerial Yoga</h3>
      <p>
        Aerial yoga — sometimes called anti-gravity yoga — is relatively new,
        but quickly catching on. It involves traditional yoga poses with the
        added support of a strong, silky hammock that hangs from the ceiling.
        The hammock is used as a supportive prop in poses like pigeon or
        downward dog, and helps you more easily perform inverted poses (like
        headstands and handstands) that might be beyond your abilities or
        comfort levels. It’s also used for a cocoon-like savasana (the final
        resting pose at the end of a yoga class). Classes can be either
        physically challenging or relaxing. <br /> “Teaching aerial yoga has
        been so rewarding for me because I get to witness beginners gain body
        awareness and overcome fear of being inverted,” says Melissa Vance, RYT
        (Registered Yoga Teacher) 200, an aerial yoga teacher based outside of
        Atlanta. “Hanging upside down reverses the blood flow in the body and
        decompresses the spine providing much relief and a euphoric feeling.”
        Who Might Like It: Those who want a nontraditional yoga experience, or
        anyone who wants the benefits of inversions but might fear going upside
        down on their own.
      </p>
      <h3>Acro yoga</h3>
      <p>
        Acro yoga takes familiar yoga poses — like downward dog or plank — and
        makes them double the fun (and sometimes double the work) by adding a
        partner. One partner serves as the “base” on the ground, while the other
        is the “flyer” who contorts themselves on the soles of the base’s feet.
        (A spotter should always be involved for safety). “[Acro yoga] allows
        people to break from the rectangular confines of their yoga mat and find
        a connection with their fellow practitioners,” says Lyle Mitchell, a
        YogaSlackers acro yoga teacher in Asheville, NC. <br /> This type of
        yoga helps you playfully explore your mind-body connection, develops
        effective communication skills with a partner, and aids in setting
        appropriate boundaries. “Exploring these skills through acro yoga can
        translate to strengthening these skills in all our other relationships
        in life,” he says. Saunders recommends acro yoga “if you are looking for
        the physical benefits of yoga in a fun and interactive environment.” If
        you work as a base, it builds a strong lower body and core. Working as a
        flyer requires flexibility and strength, not to mention trust. <br />
        Who Might Like It: Those who enjoy practicing with a partner, couples
        looking to build trust and intimacy, or anyone with an adventurous
        streak who likes to go upside down.
